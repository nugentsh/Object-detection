Allows for pictures to be taken with camera module and then image is processed to find some objects that the neural network
has been trained to recognise.
Image Resizing file exists if an image which has not been taken by the camera is used and is too large to be displayed
with raspberry pi.

Uses pre-trained Mobilenet SSD neural network, developed by Google
